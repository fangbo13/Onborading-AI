"""Docker-specific settings: uses PostgreSQL (pgvector) with DEBUG=False.

This is the correct settings module for running the app inside Docker Compose,
where PostgreSQL with pgvector extension is available.

V4.1 SYS-V4.1-001: Removed CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS — explicit whitelist instead.
V4.1 SYS-V4.1-002: Restricted ALLOWED_HOSTS from ["*"] to specific hosts.
V4.2 SYS-V4.2-010: Set DEBUG=False — prevents middleware-layer stack trace leaks.
  Previous: DEBUG=True allowed Django to return full HTML stack traces for
  middleware-layer exceptions (DisallowedHost etc.) that SafeErrorResponseMiddleware
  could not intercept (it only catches view-layer exceptions via process_exception).
  Now: DEBUG=False ensures Django never returns stack trace HTML to the client,
  regardless of which layer the exception occurs in. SafeErrorResponseMiddleware
  still provides JSON-formatted error responses for view-layer exceptions.
  A custom 500.html template is added for any remaining Django error pages.

# Database: Use PostgreSQL from Docker Compose (with pgvector support)
# This is inherited from base.py — no override needed!
# The base.py DATABASES config uses env vars that docker-compose provides:
#   POSTGRES_DB=ey_onboarding, POSTGRES_USER=ey_onboarding, etc.
# The pgvector migration (0004) will now run successfully.

# V4.1 SYS-V4.1-011: Removed SSL_VERIFY = False override.
# base.py now correctly reads SSL_VERIFY from env (default: true).
# Dockerfile has been updated with ca-certificates for HTTPS support.
