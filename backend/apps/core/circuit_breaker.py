"""DashScope circuit breaker — V4.2 SYS-V4.2-014.

Prevents DashScope API failures from blocking the server.
When consecutive failures reach the threshold, the circuit opens
and returns a degraded response until the recovery timeout passes.

Design:
- Failure threshold: 3 consecutive failures → open circuit
- Recovery timeout: 30 seconds (half-open state)
- Half-open: allows 1 test request; if it succeeds → close circuit
- Open: all requests get degraded response immediately (no DashScope call)

This protects the runserver from being blocked by DashScope timeouts
or authentication failures. In open state, users see a graceful
degradation message instead of waiting 30 seconds for a timeout.

Note: This is a process-level circuit breaker (in-memory singleton).
For multi-worker deployments (gunicorn), use Redis-backed state.
